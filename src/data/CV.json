  "about": [
    "I am a 23-year-old passionate about programming, front-end development, and UX/UI design. I am graduated in Computer Engineering from University of Sao Paulo and I actively seek to deepen my expertise in these fields through projects, courses, and other hands-on opportunities.",
    "I am also passionate about music, having played in an orchestra for seven years during my elementary and high school years. Music is an integral part of my daily routineâ€”when I'm not playing or learning an instrument, I am often listening to or researching music. Currently, I play the tenor saxophone, some transverse flute, and am working on learning the keyboard."
